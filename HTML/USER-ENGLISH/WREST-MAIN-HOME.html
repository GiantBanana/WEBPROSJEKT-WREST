            <h2>What is Wrest?</h2>
            <p>WCag Request Standard (Wrest from now on) is a standard created by five students at the Oslo and Akershus University College. Our vision is to make it a bit simpler for developers to adjust content their content in order to make it more accesible for people with different kinds of disabilities. To acomplish this we have created a simplified version of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> (WCAG from now on) so that it will be easyier to understand. In addition we have created a web browser function that addapts the web content to the individual user.</p> 
            <h2>Why Wrest?</h2>    
            <p>The Norwegian government has created <a href="https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2013-06-21-61" alt="Link to the www.lovdata section about the Discrimination and Accessibility Act">legislation</a> banning disctimination based on disabilities and making it manditoyry to design according to universal desgin standards. The law states that, from Januray 2021, every ICT system should be universally designed.</p>

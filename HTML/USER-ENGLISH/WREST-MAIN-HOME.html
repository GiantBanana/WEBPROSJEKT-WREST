            <h2>What is wREST?</h2>
            <p>WCag Request Standard (wREST from now on) is a standard created by five students at the Oslo and Akershus University College. Our vision is to make it a bit simpler for developers to adjust their content in order to make it more accesible for people with different kinds of disabilities. To accomplish this we have created a simplified version of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> (WCAG from now on) so that it will be easier to understand. In addition, we have created a prototype for a web browser extension for Chrome, which makes it possbile to adapt the content to the individual user.</p> 
            <h2>Why wREST?</h2>    
            <p>The Norwegian government has created a <a href="https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2013-06-21-61" alt="Link to the lovdata section about the Discrimination and Accessibility Act">legislation (link only in Norwegian)</a> which bans discrimination based on the disabilities and making it mandatory to design according to universal design standards. The law states that, from January 2021, every ICT system should be universally designed. According to the <a href="https://www.difi.no/artikkel/2015/10/tilgjengelighet-universell-utforming"><abbr title="Direktorate for forvalnting og IKT">Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (link only in Norwegian)</abbr></a> (Difi from now on) it is "obligatory to develop information and services that are being published online in accordance with WCAG 2.0 on a minimum rating of A or AA". Universal design is not just a moral choice, but also required by law if you live in Norway or another country with similar regulations. These new requirements means that it is necessary for developers to learn and implement the standards for universal design into their work. With wREST we are aiming to make this easier.</p>

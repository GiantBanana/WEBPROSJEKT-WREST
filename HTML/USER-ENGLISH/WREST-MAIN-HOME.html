            <p><acronym title="WCag Request Standard">Wrest</acronym> is a standard created by five students at the Oslo and Akershus University College. Our vision is to make it a bit simpler for developers to adjust content their content in order to make it more accesible for people with different kinds of disabilities. The Norwegian government has created <a href="https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2013-06-21-61" alt="Link to the www.lovdata section about the Discrimination and Accessibility Act">legislation</a> banning disctimination based on disabilities and making it manditoyry to design according to universal desgin standards. The law states that, from Januray 2021, every ICT system should be universally designed.

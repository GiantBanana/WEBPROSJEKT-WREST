            <h2>What is wREST?</h2>
            <p>WCag Request Standard (wREST from now on) is a standard created by five students at the Oslo and Akershus University College. Our vision is to make it a bit simpler for developers to adjust content their content in order to make it more accesible for people with different kinds of disabilities. To acomplish this we have created a simplified version of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> (WCAG from now on) so that it will be easyier to understand. In addition we have created a web browser function that addapts the web content to the individual user.</p> 
            <h2>Why wREST?</h2>    
            <p>The Norwegian government has created <a href="https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2013-06-21-61" alt="Link to the www.lovdata section about the Discrimination and Accessibility Act">legislation (link only in Norwegian)</a> banning disctimination based on disabilities and making it manditoyry to design according to universal desgin standards. The law states that, from Januray 2021, every ICT system should be universally designed. According to the <a href="https://www.difi.no/artikkel/2015/10/tilgjengelighet-universell-utforming"><abbr title="Direktorate for forvalnting og IKT">Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (link only in Norwegian)</abbr></a> (Difi from now on) it is "obligatory to develop information and services that are being published online in accordance with WCAG 2.0 on a minimum rating of A or AA". In other words, universal design is not just a moral choice, it has also become the law. This means that it is necessary for developers to learn and implement the standards for universal design. With wREST we are aiming to make thsi easier.</p>

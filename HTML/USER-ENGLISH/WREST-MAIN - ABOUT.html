            <h1>About wREST - English</h1>
            <p>Just as different people have different needs when it comes to tools, different people have different needs when it comes to using the web. 
				Someone who uses a wheelchair can’t use the stairs, and someone who is left-handed should have access to tools that aren’t designed for their non-dominant hand. 
				Such differences in needs is also apparent when it comes to use of the web. 
				Someone who is colorblind can’t necessarily pick up color-coded messages, and the visually impaired won’t have the easiest time reading small text. 
				Unfortunately, a lot of web designers aren’t aware of the importance of this and accessibility is often not prioritized in the development phase. 
				This is an issue that we hope to solve with wREST. 
				We offer a tool that will automatically adjust the design layout of a web page to fit your needs.

                <br>
                <br> wREST is a extention that we have developed to be used with the browser Google Chrome. 
					On installation you will create your own customized preset where you will list your preferences and needs.
					These can be everything from to adjustment of text size, to adjustment of color profiles or even text-to-speech functionality. 
					For some users, it may be necessary for assistance during the installation process. 
					wREST works by taking the style information of the website you’re trying to access and adjust it before showing you the final adjusted content. 
					One of our goals is to cooperate with websites so that they can create their own wRest presets in their own design.

                <br>
                <br> wREST follows the guidelines of accessible web design as they are described in the WCAG guidelines. 
					WCAG, which is short for Web Content Accessibility Guide, is a collection of guidelines for how a website should be designed so that it is accessible for everyone without discriminating. 
					For instance, the WCAG describes guidelines for how contrasts should be used so that someone who is visually impaired can still pick out the text, or color profiles so that someone is colorblind can still comfortably navigate the site. 
					The WCAG is a project by the Web Accessibility Initiative and is endorsed by the White House.

                <br>
                <br>In multiple countries, such as Norway, it is actually stated in the law that websites should be designed with adequate consideration so that everyone should be able to use them despite personal challenges. 
					Unfortunately, these requirements are very often ignored as web-project leaders isn’t good enough at prioritizing these guidelines when they set up their page, and many users end up meeting a wall when they find themselves on a webpage that they can’t navigate. 
					Today the web can be considered an essential tool to be a functional member in society, being used to do essential task such as paying taxes or managing social connections. 
					Therefore, it is essential that the web sites is designed in such a way that they don’t exclude anyone. 
					With the wREST project the internet will open itself for everyone and offer a minimum bar of access to any web page so that everyone can take part in our digital future.

                <br>
                <br> The wREST project started as a student project between five students from the Oslo and Akershus University College. 
					We have chosen to immerse us in web accessibility as we see it as the greatest obstacle obstructing the web from being a fundamental and safe cornerstone in our society. 
					We base wRest on research and arguments from trustworthy sources such as the WCAG or other sources such as for instance the norwegian union for the visually impaired.

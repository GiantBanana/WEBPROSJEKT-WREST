            <h1>About wREST - English</h1>
            <p>Just as different people have different needs when it comes to tools, different people have different needs when it comes to using the web. 
				Someone who uses a wheelchair can’t use the stairs, and someone who is left-handed should have access to tools that are designed for their dominant hand. 
				Differences in needs are also apparent when it comes to use of the web. 
				Someone who is colorblind can’t necessarily pick up color-coded messages, and the visually impaired won’t have the easiest time reading small text. 
				Unfortunately, a lot of web designers aren’t aware of the importance of this and accessibility is often not prioritized in the development phase. 
				This is an issue that we hope to solve with wREST. 
				We offer a tool that will automatically adjust the design layout of a webpage to fit your needs.
                <br>
     
                <br> wREST follows the guidelines of accessible web design that are described in the WCAG guidelines. 
					WCAG, which is short for Web Content Accessibility Guide, are guidelines for how a website should be designed so that it is accessible for everyone without discriminating. 
					For instance, the WCAG describes guidelines for how contrasts should be used so that someone who is visually impaired can still distinguish the text. 
					The WCAG is a project by the Web Accessibility Initiative and is endorsed by the White House.
					<br>
					<br>

					Unfortunately the WCAG is writte in such a way that it isn't comprehensible for everyone. It is written in what one could call "lawyer speak", and is a challenge by itself simply to read through. It shouldn't be this way where one would have to decipher an academic text to do accessible design. It's almost a bit ironic that a tool designet to make the world more accesible in itself presents an obstacle to anyone without an academic proficiency. As a respons to this issue we have written a simplified interpretation of the WCAG with the intention of helping programmers and project leaders making their products accesible and ethically designed.


                <br>
                <br>In multiple countries, such as Norway, it is actually stated in the law that websites should be designed with adequate consideration so that everyone should be able to use them despite their personal challenges. 
					Unfortunately, these requirements are very often ignored as web-project leaders aren't good enough at prioritizing these guidelines when they set up their page, and many users end up meeting a barrier when they find themselves on a webpage that they can’t navigate through. 
					Today the web can be considered an essential tool to be a functional member in society, being used to do essential tasks such as paying taxes or managing social connections. 
					Therefore, it is essential that the websites is designed in such a way that they don’t exclude anyone. 
					With the wREST project the internet will open itself for everyone and offer a minimum bar of access to any webpage so that everyone can take part in our digital future.
                <br>
                <br>
                wREST is a extension that we have developed especially for Google Chrome. 
					During installation you can create your own customized preset where you will list your preferences and needs.
					These can be everything from adjusting text size, to adjusting color profiles or even a text-to-speech functionality. 
					For some users, it may be necessary for assistance during the installation process. 
					wREST works by taking the style information of the website you’re trying to access and adjust it before showing you the final adjusted content. 
					One of our goals is to cooperate with websites so that they can create their own wRest presets in their own design.
					<br>


                <br> The wREST project started as a student project between five students from the Oslo and Akershus University College. 
					We have chosen to immerse ourselves in web accessibility as we see it as the greatest obstacle obstructing the web from being a fundamental and safe cornerstone in our society. 
					We base wRest on research and arguments from trustworthy sources such as the WCAG or other sources such as the Norwegian Union for the visually impaired.

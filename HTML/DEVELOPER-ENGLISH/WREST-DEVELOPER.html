          <abbr title="Wcag request standard">WRest</abbr>(Wcag request standard) is an accessebility protocol for use with the Wcag standard or as a stand alone customization alternative. By serving this information booth on the server side and client side it's easy to costomize your webpage for the user without having the user request it per site. <br/>
        </p>
          <h2> Server Side </h2>
          <p>
            The request is sendt with the <abbr title="Hyper text markup language header">HTTP Headers</abbr>, so by using standard php or other serverside language you can easily get the infromation with the request <xmp><?php echo'<?php
//Get the WRest Json config file
foreach(getallheaders() as $name => $value){
	if($name == "Wrest"){
		echo "<h1> your Wrest code is " . $value . " !!! wop wop </h1>";
	}
}
?>';?></xmp>
          </P>
          <h2> Runtime </h2>
          <p>
          By implementing the div tag with name "<strong>wRESTConf</strong>" will the browser know where to put the json config object, and you can then use javascript to access it during runtime <br/><xmp><!-- Here the JSON information from WRest will appear -->
<div hidden id="wRESTConf">  </div></xmp><br/>
